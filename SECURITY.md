# Security Policy

## Overview

We take the security and privacy of our project seriously. If you have identified any security vulnerabilities or potential threats, we strongly encourage you to disclose them responsibly. Your efforts in responsibly reporting these issues will help us ensure the safety and security of the project for everyone.

## Supported Versions

We ensure security patches are applied to the following versions of the project:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Fully Supported  |
| Older   | ⚠ Limited Support  |
| < 1.x   | ❌ Unsupported      |

If you are using an unsupported version, we highly recommend upgrading to the latest version to receive security updates and fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Use Public Channels:**
   - To protect our users, do not publicly disclose any security vulnerabilities through issue trackers, forums, or other public channels.

2. **Contact Us Directly:**
   - Report any security issues via email at **[security@project.com](mailto:security@project.com)**. Please include:
     - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
     - Steps to reproduce the issue.
     - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
     - Any suggested fixes (if available).

3. **Give Us Time to Respond:**
   - We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
   - Our security team will work with you to understand the issue and address it as swiftly as possible.

## Response and Remediation

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities quickly. Here is our typical process:

- **Initial Response:** Within **48 hours**, we will acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report.
- **Investigation:** Within **5 days**, we will review the issue, verify its validity, and determine its impact on the project.
- **Patch Development:** A security fix will be developed and tested. The timeframe for this will depend on the complexity and severity of the vulnerability.
- **Public Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will release an update and publicly disclose the issue. You will be credited for your responsible disclosure unless you prefer anonymity.

## Security Updates

Once a security patch is ready, it will be deployed in a new release of the project. Users are strongly encouraged to always update to the latest version to ensure they are protected.

Security-related updates will be clearly indicated in release notes, and patches will be tagged as "security."

## Expectations for Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate your commitment to helping us maintain the security of this project. We ask that you:

- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before publicly disclosing it.
- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and disruptions to others while testing the vulnerability.

## Thank You

We greatly appreciate the community’s efforts to ensure the security and stability of this project. Your responsible disclosure helps us maintain a safer, more robust platform for everyone.
