# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At Custom Code Builder, we take security seriously and value the contributions of security researchers. If you discover any security vulnerabilities in our project, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them to us. We are committed to promptly addressing and fixing such issues.

To report a security vulnerability, please join our Discord server at [Custom Code Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/Yn9g6KuWyA) . Once there, you can privately message one of the moderators or administrators with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability, including any relevant technical details
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any potential impact or exploit scenario
- Your name/handle and a means of contacting you for further discussion

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to address it.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy and strive to address security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Once we receive a report of a security vulnerability, we will:

1. **Confirm Receipt**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report and assign it a tracking number.
2. **Investigate**: We will investigate the reported vulnerability to validate its existence and assess its severity.
3. **Develop Fix**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will develop a fix to address it.
4. **Release Fix**: We will release the fix as soon as possible and notify our users about the security update.
5. **Credit**: We will publicly acknowledge the individual or organization that reported the vulnerability, unless requested otherwise.

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers in helping us maintain the security of Custom Code Builder and its users.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about our security practices or this policy, please contact us through our Discord server or via email at [Custom Code Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/Yn9g6KuWyA).
